Implement a function template iter that takes 3 parameters and returns nothing.
• The first parameter is the address of an array.
• The second one is the length of the array.
• The third one is a function that will be call on every element of the array.
Turn in a main.cpp file that contains your tests. Provide enough code to generate a
test executable.
Your iter function template must work with any type of array. The third parameter
can be an instantiated function template.
